1. GUI with PyQt6
The first step is to build a user-friendly graphical interface using the PyQt6 library. This will replace the command-line interface and make the tool much more accessible. The GUI should include:

Input fields: for keywords, age ranges, and the desired number of domains.

Buttons: to start the process, stop it, and export data.

Display area: for the progress bar and the results table.

2. Google Search API Integration üîç
The tool needs to integrate with the Google Search API to fetch search engine results (SERP) efficiently. The developer should:

Add a section where users can select or configure different API features.

Ensure the tool can perform searches using specific Google strings to narrow down the results, as you mentioned.

3. Performance Optimization üöÄ
To speed up the domain checking process, focus on these areas:

Asynchronous Operations: Use libraries like asyncio to perform multiple domain age checks simultaneously instead of one by one. This is the biggest factor for speed improvement.

Efficient Data Handling: Optimize how the code processes and stores data to reduce memory usage and processing time.

4. Progress Bar and Results Table üìä
The tool needs a visual way to show progress and display the results.

Progress Bar: Implement a progress bar that updates in real-time to show the user how many keywords have been processed.

Results Table: Create a table that populates with the results as they are found. The columns should be:

Keyword (Column A)

Domain (Column B)

Age (Column C)

Google String (Column D)

The table should only show domains that meet the criteria: less than 1 year old.

Advanced Filtering Option
This is a key new feature. The tool should allow users to specify a keyword-based domain criteria before the search begins.

User Input: The user will set two values:

Desired Domain Age Range: For example, between 1 and 2 years old.

Minimum Domains in SERP: For example, at least 3 domains.

Functionality: The tool will search for keywords, check the top SERP results for each keyword, and only output keywords that have at least 3 domains within the specified age range (1 to 2 years).

Output: The results table will be filtered to display only the keywords and their associated domains that meet this specific criteria.

Data Export Functionality üíæ
Finally, add an option to export the data from the results table. The export should save the data in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format, which is easy to open and analyze in spreadsheet programs like Excel or Google Sheets.
